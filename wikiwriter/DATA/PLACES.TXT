on mars
in hoboken, new jersey
in new york city
in ancient mesopotamia
in orem, utah
in tokyo, japan
somewhere in the pacific
in the jurassic period
during prohibition
during the civil war
in a faroff galaxy
inside a black hole
in los angeles, california
in chicago, illinois
in the wilds of alaska
at the north pole
deep beneath the ocean
high above the clouds
in paris, france
in the great black swamp
on the african savannah
somewhere in the irish countryside
somewhere in siberia
in the stomach of an owl
in an endless suburbia
in boston, massachusetts
five minutes from now
10 years from now
in rural idaho
near the amazon river basin
near the grand canyon
among the ruins of an ancient civilization
in houghton, michigan
in houston, texas
in death valley national park
on the coast of maine
near an unstable fault line
where a family of three mysteriously disappeared
where a child was mauled by an unknown creature
that is in the process of being sold
that is in the process of being demolished
above an indian burial ground
straddling the international date line
at the edge of a sheer cliff
