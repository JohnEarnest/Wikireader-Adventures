Kernel
======
Since the Wikireader is no longer supported and it is difficult to find binaries for the device online, I have included a copy of the compiled Forth kernel as distributed with 2011 Wikireaders. I make no claims of ownership of this binary. The complete source code for this binary and its associated documentation may be found at the [Wikireader](https://github.com/wikireader/wikireader) Github page.

If placed on a MicroSD card at device startup, this will execute code in "forth.ini" which in turn may load and execute other forth code.
